This eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of lease extraction, allowing for safe, accessible, and efficient exchange activities. This protocol cannot be upgraded and is designed to be sensor resistant.</p></div><div class="single-faq"><h2 class="text-uppercase">How do I use the Softwareploit Protocol ?</h2><p>To create a new liquidity pool, provide liquidity, swap tokens, or vote on governance proposals, go to the Softwareploit Interface and connect a Web3 wallet. Remember, every transaction on Ethereum is subject to Ether (ETH) and BEP20 (BINANCE) fees. For more detailed guidance, see our Help Guide.</p></div><div class="single-faq"><h2 class="text-uppercase">How does Softwareploit Protocol work ?</h2><p>Softwareploit is an automated market maker. In practical terms, it is a collection of smart contracts that define a standard way to create liquidity pools, provide liquidity, and exchange assets. Each liquidity pool contains two assets. The pool tracks aggregate liquidity reserves and pre-determined pricing strategies set by liquidity providers. Reserves and prices are updated automatically every time someone trades. There is no central order book, no third party custody, and no personal order matching engine. Because reserves are automatically rebalanced after each trade, Softwareploit pools can always be used to buy or sell tokens â€” unlike traditional exchanges, traders do not need to interact with individual counterparties to complete trades.</p></div></div></div></div></section>');
